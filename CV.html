Bedford Girls School Library 
I have had work experience at Bedford girls’ high school as a school assistant. My many responsibilities included putting the books and CDs back on shelves and organising them, maintaining office equipment and other general housekeeping tasks. I had to use my creativity to make a display board out of magazines as the school was on a budget and this further shows that I can make a good piece of work even if I’m on a budget.
